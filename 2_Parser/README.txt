< README for Project02 Cminus Parser Implementation >

All the codes are in 'loucomp' directory.

Report of Project02 (as a pdf file) is attached in '2_Parser' directory.

Makefile is edited. (It is EXACTLY SAME with the sample-Makefile which is posted in Project02-Discription-PDF as a guideline.)

Current state of directory is cleaned up, therefore, in order to generate 'cminus' executable file(of C_MINUS PARSER), please type "make" command.

* Working Environment: ubuntu 16.04 by using VirtualBox in Macbook Pro Retina 2015
