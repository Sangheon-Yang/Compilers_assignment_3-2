Makefile is edited, so that it can generate both "cminus_cimpl" and "cminus_flex" executable files by "make all" command.
(Current state of directory is cleaned up, so please type "make all" command in order to generate executable files.)

"cminus_cimpl" is a version of editing 'scan.c' file, "cminus_flex" is a version of using 'flex'.
